Our site is a static website focused on providing high-quality technical content and demonstrations. If you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@stackinsight.dev">hello@stackinsight.dev</a>.</p>
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>StackInsight.dev is a static website that does not require user logins, accounts, or interactive features. We do not use cookies, localStorage, or similar technologies to collect personal information. However, we may collect:</p>

  <li>Device type, browser, and general location (e.g., country-level data derived from IP addresses)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.</p>

  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Any other information you choose to provide</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party services to support our website, such as:</p>
  <ul>
